# Justobioma-portfolio-site

This is my project portfolio website. I hope to use this to showcase what skills I am
currently training with. This is a simple website that is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
This is actually a second iteration to the first site I build in August 2020. Then I showcased the web technologies I was proposing using. Now that I have actually started working and building apps with these and others, I wish to reflect that in here.
Do you have any advice or suggestions, please get in touch.
